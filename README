## Dataset

### MRI data

This dataset contains fMRI data from from three subjects ('sub-01', 'sub-02', and 'sub-03').
Each subject data contains five types of MRI data collected over multiple scanning sessions.

- 'ses-perceptionNaturalImageTraining': fMRI data from the training natural image sessions in the image presentation experiment (120 runs; 15 sessions)
- 'ses-perceptionNaturalImageTest': fMRI data from the test natural image sessions in the image presentation experiment (24 runs; 3 sessions)
- 'ses-perceptionArtificalImage': fMRI data from the geometric shape sessions in the image presentation experiment (20 runs; 2-3 sessions)
- 'ses-perceptionLetterImage': fMRI data from the alphabetical letter sessions in the image presentation experiment (12 runs; 1 session)
- 'ses-imagery': fMRI data in the imagery experiment (20 runs; 3-4 sessions)

Each scanning session consisted of functional (EPI) and anatomical (inplane T2) images.
The functional EPI images covered the entire brain (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 43 ms; flip angle, 80°; voxel size, 2 × 2 × 2 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm; number of slices, 76; slice gap, 0 mm; multiband factor, 4) and inplane T2-weighted anatomical images were acquired with the same slices used for the EPI (TR, 11,000 ms; TE, 59 ms; flip angle, 160°; voxel size, 0.75 × 0.75 × 2.0 mm; FOV, 192 × 192 mm).
The dataset also includes a T1-weighted anatomical reference image for each subject (TR, 2250 ms; TE, 3.06 ms; TI, 900 ms; flip angle, 9°; voxel size, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm; FOV, 256 × 256 mm).
The T1-weighted images were scanned only once for each subject in a separate scanning session and are stored in 'ses-anatomy' directories.
The T1-weighted images were defaced by pydeface (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydeface>).
All DICOM files are converted to Nifti-1 files by mri_convert in FreeSurfer.

### Task event files

Task event files (‘sub-\*_ses-\*_task-\*_run-\*_events.tsv’) contains recorded event (stimuli presentation, subject responses, etc.) during fMRI runs.
In task event files for image presentation experiments ('task-perception'), each column represents:

- 'onset': onset time (sec) of an event
- 'duration': duration (sec) of the event
- 'event_type': type of the event (1: Stimulus presentation block, 2: Repetition block, -1, -2, and -3: Initial, inter-trial, and post rest blocks without visual stimulus)
- ‘stimulus_id’: ID for the stimulus
- 'response_time': time of button press at the block, elapsed time (sec) from the beginning of each run ('0' means that a subject did not press the button in the block)

In task event files for imagery experiments ('task-imagery'), each column in represents:

- 'onset': onset time (sec) of an event
- 'duration': duration (sec) of the event
- 'trial_no': trial (block) number of the event
- 'event_type': type of the event (-1: rest period, 1: cue presentation period, 2: imagery period, 3: evaluation of imagery quality period, 4: inter-trial and post rest period)
- 'category_id': ImageNet/WordNet synset ID of a synset (category) which the subject was instructed to imagine at the block
- 'response_time': time of button press for imagery quality evaluation at the block, elapsed time (sec) from the beginning of each run
- 'evaluation': vividness of their mental imagery evaluated by the subject (very vivid, fairly vivid, rather vivid, not vivid, or cannot recognize the target)
